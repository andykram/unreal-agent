# unreal-agent-runner

Run an AI agent from a prompt or JSON request. It writes events to stdout as
JSONL and exits when the task finishes.

Install with Go 1.27+:

```sh
go install github.com/unreallabsai/unreal-agent/cmd/unreal-agent-runner@latest
```

Set an OpenAI API key and run a prompt in the current directory:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
unreal-agent-runner -p 'Inspect this project and explain how to run its tests.'
```

Or run from source at the repository root:

```sh
go run ./cmd/unreal-agent-runner -p 'Inspect this project and explain how to run its tests.'
```

Choose a workspace and save the output:

```sh
unreal-agent-runner -workspace ./my-project -p 'Summarize this project.' > run.jsonl
```

Sessions: `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/unreal-agent/sessions`
(override with `-session-directory`).

You can also pass a JSON request as an argument or through stdin:

```sh
unreal-agent-runner '{"prompt":"Summarize this project."}'
unreal-agent-runner < request.json
```

OpenAI is the default provider. Set `UNREAL_HARNESS_LLM_PROVIDER` to `openai`,
`openai-codex`, `openrouter`, `fireworks`, or `ollama`, and
`UNREAL_HARNESS_LLM_MODEL` to choose a model.

To use a Codex subscription, sign in with the Codex CLI, then select its
provider. The runner reads the existing ChatGPT login from
`${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/auth.json` and defaults to `gpt-6-sol`:

```sh
codex login
UNREAL_HARNESS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-codex \
  unreal-agent-runner -p 'Summarize this project.'
```

You can set `OPENAI_CODEX_AUTH_FILE` to another Codex auth file, or supply both
`OPENAI_CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`. The runner reads the
credentials when it starts; after a token expires, sign in again and restart it.
This provider uses the Codex subscription, not `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Run `unreal-agent-runner -h` for options and the JSON request fields.

## Docker

The `unrea1labs/unreal-agent` image supports Linux on AMD64 and ARM64. Run it
with a project mounted as the workspace:

```sh
docker run --rm -i --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -v unreal-agent-state:/state \
  unrea1labs/unreal-agent:latest -p 'Summarize this project.'
```

Each release also publishes its Git tag (for example, `v0.1.0`) for version pinning.
